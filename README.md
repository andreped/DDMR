# ‚ö†Ô∏è***WARNING: Under construction*** 

**DDMR** was developed by SINTEF Health Research. The corresponding manuscript describing the framework has been published in [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/) and the manuscript is openly available [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282110).

## üíª Getting started

1. Setup virtual environment:
```
virtualenv -ppython3 venv --clear
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

Use the "MultiTrain" scripts to launch the trainings, providing the neccesary parameters. Those in the COMET folder accepts a .ini configuration file (see COMET/train_config_files for example configurations).

For instance:
```
python TrainingScripts/Train_3d.py
```

## üîç Evaluate

Use Evaluate_network to test the trained models. On the Brain folder, use "Evaluate_network__test_fixed.py" instead.

For instance:
```
python EvaluationScripts/evaluation.py
```
